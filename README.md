## Key Highlights
Fraud Detection with Cohere API
SafePay leverages user-generated fraud reports and summarizes them using the Cohere API. Before initiating a transaction, users receive warnings about potentially suspicious or fraudulent recipients, thereby enhancing trust and safety in digital payments.

*Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) 3.0 Protocol*
To prevent common issues such as money being debited without reaching the recipient, SafePay implements the Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) 3.0 protocol. This ensures a secure end-to-end connection between the sender’s and recipient’s bank servers prior to initiating any transfer, eliminating transaction failures and delays in refunds.

*Secure Online Purchases*
Online shopping often comes with the fear of fraud. SafePay tackles this by providing real-time warnings if the recipient has been flagged in previous fraud reports, enabling users to transact with confidence.

*Why SafePay?*

SafePay not only secures money transfers through protocol-level reliability, but also builds user trust by actively warning about suspicious entities. With SafePay, users can transact without worrying about failed payments, delayed refunds, or fraudulent merchants.
